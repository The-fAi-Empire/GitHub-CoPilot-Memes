4. **Meme gets created** → Community turns it into art
5. **Gets featured on site** → Their @username is on display
6. **Shares their fame** → "Look, I'm on the site!"
7. **Others see it** → "I want to be featured too!"
8. **Cycle repeats** → VIRAL GROWTH! 🚀

### Why This Will Explode:

✅ **Credit & Recognition** - People love seeing their name
